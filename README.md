# VBA-Challenge

In this task I was challenged to summarize a dataset containing stats for various stocks across multiple years.  
I was to record and calculate several unique variables for each ticker in question using VBA script. 

The end result is a table consolidating all the observations per data set into a single row noting the total stock volume traded that year, the yearly change in value of that stock, and the % annual change in that stock's value.
